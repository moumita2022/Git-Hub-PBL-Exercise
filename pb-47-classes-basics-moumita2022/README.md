Add your answers directly into this file.

```js
    const now = new Date();
    const test = new Date();
```

1. In the code above, what is the `now` variable?
2. What is the type of the `now` variable?
3. In the code above, what is the `Date`?
4. What is the type of `Date`?
5. What do you get when you do `console.log(now)`?
6. What do you get when you do `console.log(Date)`?
7. What do you get when you do `console.log(new Date())`?
8. Is `now` truthy?
9. What do you get when you do `console.log(now === test)`? Why?
10. What do you get when you do `console.log(now === Date)`?
11. What do you get when you do `console.log(now === new Date())`?
12. What do you get when you do `console.log(new Date() === new Date())`? Why?
