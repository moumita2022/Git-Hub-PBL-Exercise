# Objects: Part 2

**1. Check if a number is within a given range.**
Create a function `isWithinRange` that checks if a number is within the range of an object's min and max properties. Assume min <= max is always true.

Examples:

- `isWithinRange(4, { min: 0, max: 5 })` ➞ true
- `isWithinRange(4, { min: 4, max: 5 })` ➞ true
- `isWithinRange(4, { min: 6, max: 10 })` ➞ false
- `isWithinRange(5, { min: 5, max: 5 })` ➞ true

**2. Scrabble.**
Create a function `calcMaxScrabbleScore`, given an array of scrabble tiles, counts the maximum score that a player can earn from the tiles in their hand.
Example:
```javascript
const scrabbleHand = [
  { tile: "N", score: 1 },
  { tile: "K", score: 5 },
  { tile: "Z", score: 10 },
  { tile: "X", score: 8 },
  { tile: "D", score: 2 },
  { tile: "A", score: 1 },
  { tile: "E", score: 1 }
]
```
`console.log(calcMaxScrabbleScore(scrabbleHand));` ➞ 28

    [
      { tile: "N", score: 1 },
      { tile: "K", score: 5 },
      { tile: "Z", score: 10 },
      { tile: "X", score: 8 },
      { tile: "D", score: 2 },
      { tile: "A", score: 1 },
      { tile: "E", score: 1 }
    ]

Here the player's maximum score would be `1 + 5 + 10 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 1` = 28

**3. Is it an empty object?**
Create a function `isEmptyObject` that returns true if an object is empty, and false if otherwise.

Examples:

- `isEmptyObject({})` ➞ true
- `isEmptyObject({a: 1})` ➞ false

**4. Counting Letters.**
Create a function that counts the number of occurrences of each letter in a string. Return an object with key value pairs of letters and the number of occurrences for each letter.

Example:

- `countLetters("tree")` ➞ {t: 1, r: 1, e: 2}

**5. Free Shipping.**
Create a function that determines whether an online order should get free shipping. An order gets free shipping if the total cost of items exceeds €50.

Examples:

- `freeShipping({ "Sponge": 3.50, "Soap": 5.99 })` ➞ false
- `freeShipping({ "Surround Sound Equipment": 499.99 })` ➞ true
- `freeShipping({ "Wool": 13.99, "Knitting Needles": 15.50, "Bag": 13.99 })` ➞ false

**6. Programming Object.**

```javascript
const programming = {
  languages: ["JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"],
  isChallenging: true,
  isRewarding: true,
  difficulty: 8,
  jokes: "https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-popular-computer-programming-jokes"
};
```

- Write an instruction that adds the language "Go" to the end of the languages array.

- Change the difficulty to `7`.
- Using the delete keyword, write an instruction to remove the jokes key from the programming object.
- Write an instruction to add a new key called isFun with a value of true to the programming object.
- Using a loop, iterate through the languages array and console.log all of the languages.
- Using a loop, console.log all of the keys in the programming object.
- Using a loop, console.log all of the values in the programming object.
- Add the method `worthwhile` that returns "Learning the programming languages: JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Go is rewarding and challenging" if the keys "isChallenging" and "isRewarding" have values of true
- **Bonus:** In a comment, explain what is printed if we console.log an object method without calling it and why.

**Bonus**:
- Make sure that any other code cannot delete or change properties of the object.
